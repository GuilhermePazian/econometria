THE STATE TRAFFIC FATALITY DATA SET
The data are for the “lower 48” U.S. states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), 
annually for 1982 through 1988.  The traffic fatality rate is the number of 
traffic deaths in a given state in a given year, per 10,000 people living in 
that state in that year. Traffic fatality data were obtained from the U.S. 
Department of Transportation Fatal Accident Reporting System.  
The beer tax is the tax on a case of beer, which is an available measure of 
state alcohol taxes more generally.  The drinking age variables in Table 8.1 
are binary variables indicating whether the legal drinking age is 18, 19, or 20.  
The two binary punishment variables in Table 8.1 describe the state’s minimum 
sentencing requirements for an initial drunk driving conviction:  “Mandatory jail?” 
equals one if the state requires jail time and equals zero otherwise, and 
“Mandatory community service?” equals one if the state requires community 
service and equals zero otherwise.  Total vehicle miles traveled annually 
by state was obtained from the Department of Transportation.  Personal income 
was obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the unemployment 
rate was obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
These data were graciously provided to us by Professor Christopher J. Ruhm of 
the Department of Economics at the University of North Carolina.
